# Bolt fails to execute on Windows targets because it defaults to SSH as the
# transport method.
# use the following command to execute on Windows:
# bolt apply manifests/site.pp -t winrm://win-sjdjgqkmqgl.preda.ca --no-ssl --user administrator --password-prompt
# It will install puppet agent. Sign its certificate on the Puppet Server to start using it
